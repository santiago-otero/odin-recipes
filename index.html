             <h3>What makes a good brownie</h3>

                <p>Cakey, fudgy and chewy. Cakey brownies, like the name implies, are light, moist and airy, with a slightly fluffy, cake-like interior. Fudgy brownies are moist, dense and gooey, with almost the texture of fudge, but not quite as compact.</p>

             <h3>Ingredients</h3>

               <ul>
           	    <li>2 eggs + water</li>
           	    <li>Powdered sugar</li>
         	    <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
             	<li>Oil</li>
           	    <li>Vanilla Extract </li>
               </ul>

              <h3>Step by step preparaation</h3>

               <ol>
                 <li>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>

                 <li>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>

                 <li>Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>

                 <li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
